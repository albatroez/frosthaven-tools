# WIP

This is a deckbuilder app for frosthaven built using React + vite

# WARNING THIS REPO IS NOT SPOILER FREE, THE APP IS NOT SPOILER FREE YET

To run the dev build: 
1. clone the repo 
2. run `pnpm install`
3. run `pnpm dev`



TODO Ideas:
1. Display more info/stats about chosen cards
2. Display info about class
3. Save/export builds somehow
4. Actually check if each class works (i don't want spoilers so haven't done it yet:D)
5. Implement all character specific features (eg. geminate cards per form, blinkblade initiative sorting)
